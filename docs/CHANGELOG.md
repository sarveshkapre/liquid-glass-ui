# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased
- Initial Liquid Glass UI landing page with tokens, components, and a11y notes.
- Token cards now support copy-to-clipboard (value + CSS snippet) with toast feedback.
- Export core tokens as downloadable `tokens.json` and `tokens.css`.
- Component cards include copyable usage snippets.
- Keyboard UX polish: skip-to-content link + consistent focus-visible rings.
- Keyboard demo: focus the preview search input with `/` or `Ctrl+K`.
